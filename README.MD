# Aalto Presets

A continuously evolving set of presets for Aalto, a software synthesizer from Madrona Labs.

## Categories

Most of the categories here are self-explanatory, but a few probably need explanation:

* Klangy Rhythms - Aalto has a step-sequencer that can be used to create repeating (or not-repeating) rhythms. 
* Undulations - These are tonal drones that often have some kind of underlying pulse
* Misc - Presets which haven't been categorized just yet.

## How do I install these?

If you're on a Mac, you can put them in Aalto's preset folder, which is found in `~/Music/Madrona Labs/Aalto/`
