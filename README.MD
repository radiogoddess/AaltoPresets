[WP] Since you can remember, you have always heard voices in your head. But unlike what you have seen in movies, books or other media, the voices are telling you to do...nice things

"Do it," implored the voice. It was a voice like rusted spikes, or a water well gurgling up its last dribbles of treasure. *Demonic*. The sound of a throat inside of a throat. 

"I don't want to! Please, can't you leave me alone?" I pleaded

"Do it now!"

"Why can't you--"

"**Now!**"

My hand crept out, and gingerly, I rubbed the puppy's belly.

"Tell himm he's a good boy," said the voice.

"But I--"

"TELL HIM NOWWWWWWWW!"

"Aren't you a good boy! Yes you are!" I said, forcing a smile through the tears.

I first heard the voice of Kindness on my sixth birthday. Mom invited all the neighborhood kids over. None of them were friends. None of them brought gifts, or even a card. Their parents saw the birthday party as free babysitting, and the kids saw it as a chance to get free cake and ice cream.

It was going to be my fifth birthday all over again, when I snuck into my room and cried into my pillow after spending two hours being ignored by the ten kids who had taken over my house. 

Dustin was running around and around the dining room table with the toy airplane my mom gave to me as a present--the toy airplane I didn't even get to open because Dustin pushed me aside and beat me to the box with the cat-themed wrapping paper on it. I stared at my melting ice cream cake, listening to him make airplane noises.

I was only six, and I was about to have a complete mental breakdown.

Before I could use my plastic knife on Dustin, however, I heard the blood-curdling voice of Kindness rumble, "Invite them all to your room!"

"What?" I said. 

"Your rooooooom! Let them plaaaaaaaaay with your toooooooys!"

"I don't want too. They're mean!"

"Dooooooooo iiiiiiiiiit!"

I jumped out of my chair and ran to the bedroom door. "Hey guys! Let's play with my toys!"

All the kids stopped and ran to my room.

"Woah, you've got Capsulas!" said Bruce.

"Is that a *record player*?" asked Kristie.

"Uh...yeah. Wanna see my records?" I asked.

"Yeah!" they all said.

All of a sudden, I forgot I was angry and sad. I was just showing some kids from my block all the stuff in my room.

I didn't hear Kindness for the rest of the day.

\*\*\*

The chocolate lab puppy in front of me squealed with delight, tail wagging incessantly. I was scratching his ears now with the left hand while rubbing his belly with the other.

"See, he *loves* you!" said my wife.

I wiped away the tears, which now came from love rather than the worry and anxiety of rejection.


I've read a lot about depression over the years. It comes and goes at random intervals. I take medication now, so my head is mostly devoid of monstrous voices. But, once in a while, the medication isn't enough. Sometimes, Kindness has to kick my ass into gear, to get me to do *something* for myself, or for someone else.
